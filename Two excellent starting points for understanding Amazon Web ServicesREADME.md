# Two excellent starting points for understanding Amazon Web Services

If you work in cloud computing or want to start a career in this fascinating sector, chances are you’ll want to study Amazon Web Services, the most relevant and widely used cloud computing platform. Amazon Web Services (AWS) services and technologies such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) are extensively utilized and well recognized. With so many services accessible, it’s easy to become overwhelmed by the quantity of knowledge you’ll need to understand to be an effective user. If you’re just getting started with AWS, here are three suggestions for getting started with Amazon Web Services that anyone can quickly utilize to come up to speed.

1- [Amazon Web Services Training]
One of the best platforms to understand and learn about Amazon Web Services is Netcom Learning. They mention a complete learning platform for Amazon cloud services. On their website, links for each of the courses they provide are given, and also the brief overview of how a service works, while laboratories allow for self-paced practice. Classroom training and workshops are also available in locations across the USA, as are specific online courses. On the website, you may learn more about all of the AWS training choices.
There is no learning without some way of testing your knowledge, and Netcom Learning is the ideal platform for studying cloud computing skills and services and preparation for AWS certification.

Our AWS hands-on labs and Quiz sessions, which are included in each of their AWS certification learning courses, are an excellent opportunity to practice and test what you’ve learned. Hands-on labs allow you to work directly in the AWS console to develop AWS services step by step.
Quizzes are an excellent method to assess your progress while you learn a new service or work toward AWS certification. Unlike traditional tests, theirs adjust to your performance — the more correct you are, the more challenging the questions get — and explanations are provided for each question. They are ideal for when you have 10–15 minutes to study and are especially helpful while looking for an AWS certification test.

2- Participating in Social Activities
Connecting with peers and coworkers is a fantastic method to exchange ideas and grow your network after having a solid foundation of knowledge for Amazon Web Services. If you live near an Amazon User Group, I highly encourage attending their events and activities. As an alternative, there are numerous online forums where you may meet AWS professionals. The AWS Discussion Forums are ideal for this. It provides a lot of knowledge on various topics thanks to its thousands of members and discussions. Amazon Articles & Tutorials, and videos on the AWS YouTube channel are other excellent resources for further in-depth research.
